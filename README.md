# Hey! üëã
I'm Noah, a freshman at Harvard College concentrating in Computer Science and Applied Math. I like making apps, AI/ML projects, websites, games, programs, and medical tools for friends and strangers all around the world.

## Check out some of my work:


### Automated Insulin Delivery Systems

  I have worked on Loop, an automated insulin delivery system, both as an employee at <a href="https://www.tidepool.org">The Tidepool Project</a>, where I developed new features for the FDA-approved system Tidepool Loop, and as an open-source contributor to DIY Loop, which is used by more than 20,000 patients around the world. This project accounts for the majority of my commits on this website and is a pivotal part of who I am. Not only has it changed my life by helping to ease the burden of type 1 diabetes, but it has also taught me the power of code.

  These apps, published on the Apple App Store by Noble and Greenough School and Appier LLC, respectively, were programmed by me and are available free of charge. They consist of an all-encompassing system to improve the lives of students and teachers, a daily diary and mood tracker built to improve happiness, and finally a fun, social-networking game where users take quizzes about themselves and send them to their friends to determine who knows them best. The apps have over 8,000 downloads, 2 million total sessions, and hundreds of daily active users. While my apps span a variety of categories, each one was built with love and purpose to brighten the lives of others.

  I value open-source projects as a way to give back to the community that has helped me throughout my coding journey. These apps are not yet on the App Store, but are still my beloved original creations. Many of these projects are AI-focused, as it is a particular interest of mine within the field of computer science.
