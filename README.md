# Hey! 👋
I'm Noah, a freshman at Harvard College concentrating in Computer Science and Applied Math. I like making apps, AI/ML projects, websites, games, programs, and medical tools for friends and strangers all around the world.

## Check out some of my work:

### Automated Insulin Delivery Systems
<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>
  I have worked on Loop, an automated insulin delivery system, both as an employee at <a href="https://www.tidepool.org">The Tidepool Project</a>, where I developed new features for the FDA-approved system Tidepool Loop, and as an open-source contributor to DIY Loop, which is used by more than 20,000 patients around the world. This project represents much of my work on GitHub and is central to who I am. Loop has not only improved my life by easing the burden of type 1 diabetes but has also shown me the extraordinary power of code to create meaningful, far-reaching impact.

### Apps on the App Store
<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>
These apps, published on the Apple App Store by Noble and Greenough School and Appier LLC, were programmed by me and are available free of charge. They include a comprehensive platform designed to support students and teachers, a daily journal and mood tracker that promotes happiness, and a social game where users test how well their friends know them. Collectively, the apps have surpassed 8,000 downloads, accumulated over 2 million sessions, and maintain hundreds of daily active users. Though they span diverse categories, each was created with the shared goal of making life a little brighter for others.

### Open Source Apps
<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>
  I value open-source projects as a way to give back to the community that has helped me throughout my coding journey. These apps my original creations that have not made it to the App Store. Many of these projects are AI-focused, as it is a particular interest of mine within the field of computer science.
