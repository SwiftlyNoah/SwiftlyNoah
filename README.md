# Hey!
I'm Noah, a senior at Noble and Greenough School. I like making apps, websites, games, programs, and medical tools for friends and strangers all around the world.

## Check out some of my work:

  I have worked on Loop, an automated isulin delivery system, as both an employee at [The Tidepool Project](https://www.tidepool.org), where I developed new features for the FDA-approved system Tidepool Loop, and as an open-source contributor to DIY Loop, used by more than 20,000 patients around the world. This special project accounts for the majority of my commits on this website and is a pivotal part of who I am. Not only has it changed my life by helping to ease the burden of type one diabets, it has taught me the power of code.

  I value open-source projects as a way to give back to the community that has helped me throughout my coding journey. These apps are not yet on the App Store, but are still all original creations by me. Many of these projects are AI-focused, as it is a particular interest of mine within the field of computer science.
